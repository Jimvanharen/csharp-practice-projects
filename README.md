# csharp-practice-projects
Here you will see my projects I created as an education tool to learn the fundamentels of C# most of them are a ConsoleApplication.


You can do whatever you want with these projects I dont really care.
I would actually love to see if the Timer can become better.


You can download the executable file to see how the program looks like its called -ConsoleEggTimer exe.exe-


You can look at the source code to see how the program works.

I will come with new projects every now and then, I hope you're excited!

EGGTIMER V1.0 

This (Egg)timer is created to learn variables, loops, comparisons and methods.

I hope you'll get a better understanding of those terms after looking at the program.
You can also learn a lot if you tweak some stuff in the Eggtimer.

Happy tweaking!
