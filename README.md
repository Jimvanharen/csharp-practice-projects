# csharp-practice-projects
Here you will see my projects I created as an education tool to learn the fundamentels of C# most of them are a ConsoleApplication.


You can do whatever you want with these projects I dont really care.
I would actually love to see if the Timer can become better.


You can download the executable file to see how the program looks like its called -ConsoleEggTimer exe.exe-


You can look at the source code to see how the program works.
